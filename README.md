# Spring School Museum Template

This repository serves as base for a workshop for creating virtual reality (VR) exhibitions for people with little experience with Unity or game development using [ExPresS XR (**Ex**perimentation and **Pres**entation for **S**cience with Open**XR**)](https://github.com/eisclimber/ExPresS-XR).
It was originally developed, together with a numismatic-themed VR Exhibition, as an internal workshop day for the CIVIS Days 2023 at the Eberhard Karls University Tübingen.
Because of the great feedback and interest during the workshop we decided to release the materials to let others host their own workshops or try it out by themselves.

The Workshop uses an handout to describe the progress of creating an exhibition. You can find the handout and a finished exhibition under the folders “Assets/_Handout” and “Assets/_CompletedExhibit” respectively.

The workshop is divided in 4-5 sessions:

1. Hands-On Gaming: Where people can try out the numismatic-themed VR Exhibition. Use the "VR Controls" section at the end of the handout as reference for how to move in VR.
2. Practical Session 1: Featuring an Introduction to Unity and people will create their exhibition room. Depending on their experience the subsection "Add Room Features" can be omitted.
3. (Optional) Hands-On 3D-Scanning: Ideally an input session for 3D Scanning either using professional tools like the Artec Spider or [using free tool](https://github.com/eisclimber/ExPresS-XR/wiki/Converting-Real-World-Objects-to-3D-Models).
4. Practical Session 2: Creating a Button Quiz about Numismatics.
5. Practical Session 3: Finishing the exhibition by filling the Exhibition Displays and building the game

We are very grateful for sharing images about your workshop and also any feedback regarding the workshop or ExPreS XR.

## Preliminaries

There are some things that need to be prepared before the workshop:

- Perform the workshop on your own in beforehand.
- Unity Hub and the Unity Editor 2021.3.21f1 must be installed. If you are using Meta Quests 2, make sure that Android build Support ist also installed.
- Print out the handout.
- Test your 3D-Scanning session beforehand if you decide to have one and make sure to have a backup if the scan fails.
- Start the Project at least once to make sure everything works correctly. Ideally also build the completed Exhibition scene as test and move it to your VR headset. Make sure to switch back to an empty scene afterwards.
- If using a Quest 2: Install the Meta Quest Developer Hub and log in. This requires a Meta/Facebook Account.
- If using a PC headset: Install Steam and Steam VR. This requires a Steam Account, which people must have access to.
