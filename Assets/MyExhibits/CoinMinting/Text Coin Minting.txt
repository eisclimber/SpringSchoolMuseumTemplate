Roman coins were created from pre-shaped disks made from metals like, gold, copper or bronze.
These ''mints'' were then clamped between two dies and struck with a hammer. This served the purpose of stamping the coin's face from the die onto the coin.
After striking the coin, another worker added details like the curls of hair or lettering, to make sure the coin was perfect.
