The Onager was a roman catapult used roughly between the 4th and 6th century. 
This siege weapon got its power via torsion. 
It was generated by placing the arm between multiple ropes. 
Twisting the ends of the of ropes applied a force to the arm and the frame. 
When the arm is released, the stored energy is suddenly converted to kinetic energy, propelling the arm and its payload forward.
