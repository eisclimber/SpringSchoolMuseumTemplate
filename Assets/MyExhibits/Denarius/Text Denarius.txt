This is a roman Denarius. The front shows the head of Rome, wearing a helmet, whilst looking to the right. 
The face also has a “X” – or rather the Roman numeral for 10 – imprinted in the lower right. 
This indicated that the coin was worth 10 acres, the less valuable bronze coin of that area.

The back shows a chariot as a symbol of victory.
